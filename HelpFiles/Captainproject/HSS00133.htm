<HR>
</EM></STRONG>
<P><FONT color=#000000>This Screen 
allows the System Administrator to manage all of the individual tracking tasks/questions 
that are available in the Client Tracking Screen for Users to work 
with.&nbsp; Access to this screen should be limited to very few Users.&nbsp; 
If you have all Users adding in new questions or updating existing questions 
there will be confusion and frustration.&nbsp; One User could potentially create 
a question to use and then another User could immediately change it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Assigning the role of maintaining this area of the system 
is best if only one or two Users do it.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Setting up the Master Track and 
Components is crucial for an agency that is stirving for accurate tracking and 
reporting.&nbsp; The Master Track will contain a User-defined series of tasks 
that will be available to work with.&nbsp; The main objective is to collect all 
the necessary information for the PIR.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>There is a Master Track and then Component 
Tracks you will interact with.&nbsp; Think about it this way - 
The Master Track is one group of questions that included EVERY task/question in 
the system.&nbsp; One master file with everything in it.&nbsp; Components act as 
a filter to eliminate looking at tasks that are not relative to what the User is 
reviewing.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000> 
  Additional Component Tracks can 
be created (so that specific content area specialists don't have to look through 
the full Master list to find what they want to work with).&nbsp; For example, a 
User focused on Health will find their experience less cumbersome if they don't 
have to look&nbsp;through Family Services tasks or&nbsp; Education/Disabilities tasks.&nbsp; 
Another&nbsp;example Users can benefit from Component Tracks is Health/EPSDT 
tasks.&nbsp; That User will be glad to be able to call up the specific tasks to 
work with for EPSDT without seeing anything else.&nbsp; </FONT></P><FONT color=#000000>
