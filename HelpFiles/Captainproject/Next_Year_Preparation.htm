Use the Next Year Preparation Report Screen to roll over 
Intakes into the next program year.&nbsp; The system is partitioned by program 
year.&nbsp; Once the year is done and ALL attendance has been posted the System 
Administrator can roll over the system to the next program year.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P ><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri>That fundamental 
approach above shared, because it is the BEST approach, the System Administrator 
can rollover the system without ALL attendance postings completed in the year 
that is ending.&nbsp; What that creates is the need for ALL Users to change the 
year in the system to post attendance for the correct year.&nbsp; You see, once 
the system rolls over, the default year changes to the next year.&nbsp; A User 
can, however, push the system back to the previous year and post attendance 
until it is completed.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P > <FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri>Let's understand 
the template screen you need to use:</FONT></P>
<P > <IMG alt="" src="NYP_mainscreen.JPG"></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri>In the top 
section of the screen you will find various filters that you can use to tell the 
system what you want in place when the rollover happens.&nbsp; Note the Head 
Start Cutoff Field is the only required field.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just because the 
other fields are not required doesn't mean they aren't important!&nbsp; 
</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<DIV > <FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri ><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Report Sequence -&nbsp; 
  </STRONG>when the system completes the roll over action a report</FONT> will 
  be generated to tell the User which Intakes rolled over.&nbsp; This filter 
  establishes the order of the Intakes in that 
report.</FONT></DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV ><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri><STRONG>Enroll Status -&nbsp; </STRONG>Both is the deafult 
  selection.&nbsp; You can change it to enrolled or not enrolled.&nbsp; Each 
  filter will produce a different list of Intakes.&nbsp; Both ensures the system 
  picks up ALL qualifying Intakes.</FONT></DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV ><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri><STRONG>Children - </STRONG>Both is the default, children and 
  repeaters are additional filters.&nbsp; Sometimes programs want to roll over 
  by category.&nbsp; This filter will allow that process.&nbsp; If you want to 
  do just one rollover, select both.</FONT></DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV ><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri><STRONG>Roll 
  Over - </STRONG>This filter is awesome, because it allows you to run a list 
  selecting Produce List Only filter and double check what's going to 
  happen.&nbsp; Until you run this report with the filter Rollover Data to the 
  New Year, nothing happens other than the system genertating a list.&nbsp; 
  Selecting Rolover Data to the New Year will have the system completed the 
  entire rollover (based on all filters selected in this screen) and the results 
  are permanent.&nbsp; The next program year will be built and in place for 
  Users to work in.</FONT></DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV ><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri><STRONG>Head 
  Start Cutoff -&nbsp; </STRONG>the number you place in this box tells the 
  system was age (by year) to stop at when completing the rollover.&nbsp; If you 
  put 5 in this box, any Intake with HS Funding where the child in the primary 
  client position&nbsp;is 6 or older will not rollover to the next year.&nbsp; 
  This filter allows the system administrator to limit the Intakes that are in 
  the next year.&nbsp; It should be shared that you can roll over ALL Intakes 
  into the next without creating any problems.&nbsp; Some System Administrators 
  just like to eliminate any child that would never be served in the program in 
  the next year.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV ><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri><STRONG>Headstart/DayCare Cutoff - </STRONG>this box functions 
  the same as the Head Start Cutoff box with the exception of the funding.&nbsp; 
  Children that are tagged for both HS and DC will be part of this age cut 
  off.</FONT></DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV ><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Calibri><STRONG>DayCare Cutoff -&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG>this box functions

  do.&nbsp; Take your time and think through your options.&nbsp; When you first 
  check this box the working screen below opens:</FONT></FONT></DIV></LI></UL>
