The Program Enrollment Screen allows you to manage a list of clients that are&nbsp;in your program 
and also potential referrals into your program identified in the SIM (Service Integration 
Matrix).&nbsp;</P>
<P>         
         The top 
section of the screen delivers an accounting of the number 
of clients you have interacted with.&nbsp; They could be enrolled, wtihdrawn, be on 
the wait list, denied or pending.&nbsp; It gives the User an accurate look at the clients 
that you are working with, or have worked with, in the program enrollment 
year.</P>
<P>        
         The program enrollment year 
is set in program definition by your System Administrator.&nbsp; Activity for all Intakes must fall within 
the defined program year.&nbsp; The program year definition can be changed/adjusted at any 
time.</P>
<P>        
    The top section of the screen presents current counts 
in the columns for each program displayed.&nbsp; The bottom section of the screen, based on the 
SHOW, AS OF DATE, and STATUS filter selections will display the Intakes that 
qualify.&nbsp;</P>

<P>Adding system referrals to the program hierarchy is the 
way the system goes out and gets the referrals that were sent in the SIM.&nbsp; 
This must be completed in order to be able to enroll a client.&nbsp; Think of it as the way 
the system goes out and gets the referrals that were sent so 
that they will show up in this working screen.&nbsp;</P>

the application in the working hierarchy is a match (by looking at SSN, DOB and 
NAME).&nbsp; If the system finds a client record that matches the referred 
client the system will synchronize the records.&nbsp; If it doesn't find 
  a match you will be able to drag the applicant into the working hierarchy.&nbsp;

<P>     CREATE STATUS RECORD - by assigning a status date and a
