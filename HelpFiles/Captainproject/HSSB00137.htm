<p><FONT size=3 face=Calibri>Attendance Posting by 
Site screen allows you to manage all attendance and meal records for all children enrolled 
your program.&nbsp; This feature makes managing attendance and meal records FAST and 
EASY.&nbsp; This screen is designed so that the User never has to leave the 
screen in order to affect all the data entry using their own preferred 
filters.</FONT></p>
<p><FONT size=3 face=Calibri>What that means is a User can post for just 
one day, or post for an entire week during one posting session.&nbsp; All data 
entry can be completed and then one SAVE to be done.</FONT></p>
<p><FONT size=3 face=Calibri><STRONG>IMPORTANT 
NOTE****</STRONG> - The very first posting that is completed for a child is a 
PRESENT.&nbsp; <STRONG>Never post an ABSENT before a PRESENT.</STRONG>&nbsp; The 
system calculates dates of entry and other important details that are connected 
to attendance.&nbsp; In addition, once attendance has been posted the ADA Report 
picks up all posting records.&nbsp; </FONT></p>
<p><FONT size=3 face=Calibri>When you select Attendance Posting by Site 
in the screen tree this screen tab opens:</FONT></p>

<p><FONT size=3 face=Calibri>This is a read only screen until you 
activate it by clicking the <IMG alt="" src="add button.JPG">&nbsp;(Add Button) 
or the <IMG alt="" src="edit button.JPG">&nbsp;(Edit Button).&nbsp;&nbsp; Many 
times a User only wants to access a class list and ulitmately attendance or meal 
records to reference them.&nbsp; The ability to review saved records in read 
only mode ensures that no changes are accidentally made by a User who may not be 
trained in the attendance posting data entry process.&nbsp; </FONT></p><FONT size=2>
