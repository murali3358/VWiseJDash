<P><FONT color=#000000>The PIR Counting 
Tool is where any User that works with the annual PIR Report can monitor or 
manage data throughout the program year.&nbsp; Never wonder what a particular 
number is again.&nbsp; The aggregated counts that are presented in this screen 
are calculated based on the most recent PIR Control update in the system.&nbsp; 
New children are enrolled in the program each and every day.&nbsp; New children 
have a first attended day.&nbsp; The system considers every child that is 
enrolled and has attended one day in the PIR Counting Tool.&nbsp; 
It's best practice to run the PIR Control prior to reviewing counts in this 
screen to ensure you are giving the system the opportunity to consider 
every child it should.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>  
              
      Let's understand the screen before we 
try to use it. </FONT></P>
<P>At the very top right hand position of the screen we can 
see the program year that the system is currently operating in.&nbsp; This field 
allows the User to decide WHICH program year they want to work in and change it 
if necessary.&nbsp; (i.e., if your User work session requires that you make a 
reference to a previous year's report you can change the year in this 
field.)&nbsp;</P>
<P>When you look at the screen below you can see (at the top 
of the screen) that the User MUST select the section of the report and&nbsp;the 
correct program option filter in order to be certain the report being reviewed 
is the correct one.&nbsp; The default filters are Section C and&nbsp;HS 
Fund.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Select the desired section for your work session in the 
drop down field and then Left Mouse Touch EHS Fund to change the default 
selection.&nbsp; The User can also review the report for ALL SITES or just a 
specific site.&nbsp; Each User and each User's work session can be 
different.&nbsp; The system will generate counts and a full report based on the 
filtered selections the User makes.&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="PIR_Counting_Tool.JPG"></P>
<P>Note on the right-hand side of the screen there are two columns.&nbsp; SYSTEM and 
USER.&nbsp; The system will update the Counting Tool when the User clicks the 
Generate PIR Counts button.&nbsp; The system column will present all qualifying data 
found in the system (based on the PIR logic associations set in place in 
the system).&nbsp; The User column allows the individual User to input a number 
they want to note.&nbsp; This may be the actual target number or perhaps&nbsp;the 
number the User feels it should be.&nbsp;&nbsp; This feature allows a User to&nbsp;bring 
analysis and&nbsp;comparison into their work session without having to maintain a 
paper document outside of the system.&nbsp;</P>
<P>              
             
            
              
             
             
             
       In this particular screen 
there are several report generating buttons.&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="PIRCT_GeneratePIR.JPG">&nbsp;&nbsp;asks the 
system to generate a complete report for review.&nbsp; There are times you 
cannot be in front of your system and need              
             
            
              
             
             
             
          to 
have a paper report in hand.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="PIRCT_GenerateAuditReport.JPG"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;aks the system to analysis the aggregated count of a              
             
            
              
             
             
           specific PIR 
question and present that data for review.&nbsp; A User can only 
audit one question at a time.</P>
<P>              
             
            
      When the User selects the check box directly 
to the left of the row of a specific question the system will 
generate an audit report.&nbsp; Whenever an audit report is generated only qualifying children 
will be on the list.&nbsp; What that means is if the PIR Control 
was not updated prior to working with the report, there could 
be children missing from the list.&nbsp;</P>
<P>              
             
 The system will present a list of ALL children that qualified 
for the PIR report and indicate a HIT for each child that has qualifying 
data for the specific question being audited.&nbsp; The audit report becomes the reference 
tool a content area specialist can use to determine if there should be 
any adjustments to the report.&nbsp; It's also a reliable tool to utilize when 
determining children they may not have achieved a specific goal or 
deadline in their individual program experience.&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="PIRCT_GeneratePIRCounts.JPG">              
             
            
              
             
     &nbsp;asks the system to generate current report counts 
in the screen.&nbsp; Best practice is to generate counts every time you open 
the screen before reviewing data to ensure the system is presenting 
the most current aggregated counts possible.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="PIRCT_SaveReportCounts.JPG">              
             
            
              
             
             
             
  &nbsp;asks the system to save the report counts, including 
User input counts into the screen.&nbsp;</P>
