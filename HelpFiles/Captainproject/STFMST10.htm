<P>The Staff Master Screen is used to ADD staff that need to be assigned to the 
Classroom and staff that need to be reported on the PIR Report. Teachers, 
Assistant Teachers and Parent Volunteers that help within the classroom are just 
a few examples. This should be set-up prior to setting up the Site and Room 
Maintenance Screen in order to select the teaching staff in the Classroom 
Screen. You can always return to the Screen and complete it at a later date, if 
necessary. </P><FONT size=2>
<P>In order to effectively interact with Section B of the PIR Report the User 
should treat this Screen as a required field Screen across the board. What you 
do not enter into the Screen, you will have to go hunting for at a later date. 
Best practice would be to enter the information for every staff that the funding 
source allocation is HS or EHS. You never know when you will want the 
comprehensive look at staff data that is collected in this Screen.
