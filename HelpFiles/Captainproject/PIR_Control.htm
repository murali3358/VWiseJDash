 This screen is used to 
create a summary transaction for each child that qualifies&nbsp;for the 
PIR&nbsp;Counting Tool. This file stores much information to speed up the 
processing time of the overall counting while all Users are accessing the 
tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for a         
            
           
 child's application to be on the Attn 
1 Day list, the child must have been enrolled in a classroom and 
also must have at least one PRESENT attendance posting completed during the program 
year.&nbsp;</FONT> </P></FONT>

Of more importance,                
             
this Screen controls the applications that are updated in the PIR Counting 
Tool.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT size=2>This control must be 
updated by the User <STRONG>prior</STRONG> to reviewing the PIR 
Counting Tool to ensure that the numbers that are reviewed are as current as 
possible.&nbsp; (new enrollment or attendance records are added in.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Let's understand 
that!&nbsp; If the User who enrolls children in the system enrolls a child on 
Monday morning and then a User at the Center posts attendance at the center the 
PIR Control must be run in order for the system to find the NEW enrollment and 
attendance data.&nbsp; Once the system finds that child's application all of the 
data that the PIR Counting Tool picks up for that child will now be picked up 
when the PIR Counting Tool generates counts.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>How does a User run the 
PIR Control?&nbsp; Easy.&nbsp; The User Generates the Work Data and then Creates 
the Work File.&nbsp; This process takes seconds and will become a standard 
process for Users that are interacting with the PIR Counting 
Tool.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Locate the <STRONG>Generate Work Data</STRONG> and <STRONG>Create Work&nbsp;File&nbsp;</STRONG>buttons&nbsp;in the 
lower left hand corner of the screen. </FONT></P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="PIR_Control_generate_work_data_buttons.JPG"></P>
<P><FONT size=2>These two buttons are presented together to 
ensure that from the beginning a User understands that BOTH processes must be 
completed to ensure that the data reviewed in the PIR Counting Tool is as 
current as possible.&nbsp; This process takes seconds!&nbsp; Work from left to 
right.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Click <STRONG>Generate Work Data 
  </STRONG>button</FONT></DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Click <STRONG>Create Work File

<P><FONT size=2>Any User that works with the PIR Counting 
Tool should create a routine habit of updating the PIR Control to ensure the 
records are updated and counts are as current as possible.&nbsp; If a User 
thinks a particular PIR question count is incorrect there is every potential 
that a PIR Control record update will produce different data for review!&nbsp; 
(Maybe a child was recently enrolled or another User just posted 
attendance.)</FONT></P><FONT size=2>
